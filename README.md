# Forecast-Bike-Rentals-Project-

## Project Objective

  The primary goal of this project is to forecast bike rental demand on an hourly basis by utilizing historical usage patterns and weather data.
  Specifically, we aim to predict the number of bike users ('cnt') based on the provided "Bikes Rental" dataset.

## Methodology

  To achieve this goal, we will employ a range of machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model.
  The chosen model using one of the available model fine-tuning techniques.
  The optimal combination of hyperparameters for the selected model, thereby ensuring its optimal performance.

## Evaluation

  In the final phase, we will utilize the refined model to make predictions.
  We will assess its accuracy by comparing the predicted values with the actual values from the dataset.

## Conclusion

 This comprehensive approach will enable us to develop a robust and accurate bike rental demand prediction system.
